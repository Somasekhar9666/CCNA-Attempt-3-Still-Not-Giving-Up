Core Answer (in one line)
Because OSI is a conceptual teaching model, while TCP/IP is the real protocol suite that actually runs the Internet.
So when we talk about IP routing, Ethernet, hops, we are describing real TCP/IP behavior, and then mapping it back to OSI for understanding.

1️⃣ OSI vs TCP/IP — fundamental difference
OSI Model
* A theoretical reference model
* Created to explain networking concepts
* Defines what should happen, not how it is implemented
* No real OS uses pure OSI protocols
TCP/IP Model
* A practical protocol suite
* Created to build the Internet
* Defines exact protocols (IP, TCP, Ethernet, etc.)
* Actually runs on your laptop, router, ISP
📌 That’s why real discussions feel TCP/IP-heavy.

2️⃣ Why routing & hop-by-hop feel “TCP/IP-ish”
Because:
Concept	Real Protocol
Routing	IP
Hop-by-hop delivery	Ethernet / L2
Segmentation	TCP / UDP
Framing	Ethernet
Addressing	IP + MAC
All of these belong to TCP/IP suite, not OSI.
But…

3️⃣ So why do we still use OSI?
Because OSI gives:
* Clean mental separation
* Layered troubleshooting
* Vendor-neutral explanation
* Exam-friendly structure
Think of OSI as:
A map, not the road itself.

4️⃣ OSI is a “lens” — not the network itself
When we say:
* “Layer 2 does hop-by-hop”
* “Layer 3 does routing”
* “Layer 4 does segmentation”
We are classifying TCP/IP behavior into OSI layers.
OSI does not perform routingIP does.
OSI does not perform framingEthernet does.

5️⃣ Why CCNA teaches OSI first
Because without OSI:
* Everything becomes one big mess
* No clean fault isolation
* No structured thinking
Example:
“Website not loading”
With OSI:
* Physical → cable?
* Data link → ARP?
* Network → IP route?
* Transport → TCP handshake?
* Application → HTTP?

6️⃣ Mapping (THIS is the missing clarity)
TCP/IP → OSI mapping
TCP/IP	OSI
Application	L7 + L6 + L5
Transport	L4
Internet (IP)	L3
Network Access	L2 + L1
📌 That’s why WAN, routing, Ethernet appear outside OSI — they are mapped into it, not born from it.

7️⃣ Why we explain packets using OSI even though TCP/IP is real
Because OSI:
* Explains who does what
* Explains where problems occur
* Explains why hop-by-hop works
Without OSI:
“Router strips header and rebuilds frame”sounds magical.
With OSI:
“Router removes L2, reads L3, rebuilds L2”sounds logical.

8️⃣ Your confusion (explicitly addressed)
Your thought:
“Everything we discussed seems TCP/IP related, not OSI.”
Correct conclusion:
Yes — because OSI is a teaching abstraction layered on top of TCP/IP reality.
This is not a flaw — it’s intentional.

9️⃣ Real-world analogy (perfect mental model)
OSI = anatomy textbook
* Names body systems
* Explains roles
TCP/IP = actual human body
* Heart actually pumps
* Lungs actually breathe
You study anatomy to understand the body — but the body doesn’t “run anatomy”.

🔒 Final lock-in statement (remember this)
OSI explains networking.TCP/IP does networking.We describe TCP/IP behavior using OSI layers for clarity.
